        The ultimate cocktail database on the web. We got 'em all; beer, wine,
        liquor, you name it we got it for sure. Don't look elsewhere for your
        alcoholic needs. Seriously don't, it would be a waste of your time
        because we gathered all the booze there was in the world right here in
        one place for your convenience, you're welcome.
